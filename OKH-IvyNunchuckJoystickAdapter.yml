title: Ivy Nunchuck Joystick Adapter
description: The Ivy Nunchuck Joystick Adapter is an Open Assistive Technology (OpenAT)
  device that enables a user to utilize a Nintendo Nunchuk Controller or generic
  Nunchuck Controller as a USB Gamepad or USB Mouse. It is a cost-effective,
  customizable option for computer access and adapted gaming. The device
  consists of commercial-off-the-shelf electronic components, a 3D printed
  enclosure, and custom firmware. Assembly of the device requires no specialized
  tools beyond a 3D printer to create the enclosure and a computer to flash the
  firmware.
intended-use: "The Ivy Nunchuck Joystick Adapter is intended to be used by people with
  disabilities as an alternative input device for computers, mobile devices, and
  gaming consoles. It is compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller, and any
  other host device that is compatible with a USB HID Mouse or USB HID Gamepad.
